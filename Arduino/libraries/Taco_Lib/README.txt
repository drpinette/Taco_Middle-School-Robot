To members and maintainers of this robot.
  I leave you this Git so you can maintain and work on your robot from here on and into the future.  Respect the FRSRobotics Git and only use it to ensure that your code is of similar function or to have a template to work off of for your robot.  A few functions that are vital are the [fullStop();] function.  This function has a pause(or stop) of ~100000ms. (Which won't make the robot move futher in the code... for a while... a loonngg while...).  Anyways, enjoy making your robot.  And WIN the Competition for not only you, but for members from the past(no pressure).
Sincerely
David J Esch
Former Leader of Programming and Maintainance
